This repository's goal is to be a starting point for Python projects.

It uses:

- [git](http://git-scm.com) for version control
- [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) to manage Python packages
- [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for automation and setup development environments
- [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) for documentation

## docs

Directory where you'll store the [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) configuration files and
where the documentation will be generated.

## .gitignore

File where you specify which files [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) should ignore.

A generic file has been provided.

You can use [gitignore.io](http://www.gitignore.io) to
produce other files that will better suit your development environment.

For more information, you can check "[git-scm.com : gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)".

## LICENSE

The Apache 2 license.

Feel free to replace for another license that will be more suitable to the purpose of your project.

## pytest.ini

The [pytest](https://pytest.org/latest/index.html) configuration file.

You can read
"[pytest : Changing standard (Python) test discovery](https://pytest.org/latest/example/pythoncollection.html)"
for more information on how to use this file to customize [pytest](https://pytest.org/latest/index.html)'s behavior.

## README.md

This file.

Check "[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)" for help
with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

## requirements.txt

On this file you specify the list of packages the project depends.

Read "[pip : Requirement Files](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files)"
to understand how you can properly use this file to define your project's dependencies.

## setup.py

The setup script whre you'll describe the project / product, authors, maintainers and
information on how to distribute it.

Read "[Python : 2. Writing the Setup Script](http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html)",
for more information.

## steenzout

This is the directory which will hold your files.

Rename "steenzout" with your GitHub's handle.

In this empty project the `steenzzout` package is a namespace package, meaning it was defined in another repository.

You may not need to do this but it's here to make an example of how to define namespace packages,
what to add on the `init.py` file and in the `setup.py` file.

## tests

The directory where you should add your unit tests.

## test-requirements.txt

On this file you specify the list of packages the project needs to run its tests.

An example of the possible contents of this file has been provided.

Read "[pip : Requirement Files](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files)"
to understand how you can properly use this file to define your project's test dependencies.

## tox.ini

The [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) configuration file.

It contains basic information about your project and test environments.

I recommend [installling tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and
use it to run your tests and generate the documentation.

```bashs
# run the tests
$ tox

# generate the documentation
$ tox -e docs
```
